How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It help me because I can easily view what was added and remove from the file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because I can keep track of the changes I make to the file and restore a previous versions in case theres any error in the new one 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

I think the pros are that your commits would be logical and more easy to understand and the con would be that you can forget to do a commit after a change 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is a version control system thats more oriented to coding

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The git log I can use to see a history of all the commits and git diff to view the different between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because i know i can go back to previous files

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
